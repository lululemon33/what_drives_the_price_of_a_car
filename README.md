# What drives the price of a car

## Overview

From a business perspective, we are tasked with identifying key drivers for used car prices. In the CRISP-DM overview, we are asked to convert this business framing to a data problem definition. Using a few sentences, reframe the task as a data task with the appropriate technical vocabulary.

Basically, we have been provided a dataset that contains 426K sales transactions of used cars (minimized from 3 million to avoid resource exhuastion).  The objective for the data scientist is to understand what characteristics of used cars that were previously sold can be used to predict a future sales price.  This type of prediction will help the car dealership (a.k.a. the client) to choose inventory and to more or less accurately price chosen inventory.
